        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background</b>: I call Asheville, NC home. I've lived all over the state, including Wilmington (where I met my wife), and Charlotte, 
                which is where I currently live. My wife and I spent the last year traveling the country in a camper van that we converted ourselves and it was amazing. 
                I'm now looking to finish my degree and work remotely so we can hit the road again!</li>

            <li><b>Professional Background</b>: I've mostly worked in the service industry but I've also worked in a paper mill, and for a trucking company. 
                Most recently, I was an Assistant Manager at Autobell Car Wash here in Charlotte.</li>

            <li><b>Academic Background</b>: I've spent what feels like a decade working toward an Associate's Degree because I was never able to 
                figure out what I wanted to do with my life, but now I'm committed to earning my degree in Web Technologies.</li>

            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform</b>: MacBook Pro</li>

            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why</b>: 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>CSC-143</b>: I need this course to finish my Web Tech degree.</li>
                    <li><b>DBA-120</b>: I need this course to finish my Web Tech degree.</li>
                    <li><b>DBA-285</b>: I need this course to finish my Web Tech degree.</li>
                    <li><a href="contract.html"><b>WEB-215</b></a>: I need this course to finish my Web Tech degree.</li>
                    <li><b>WEB-250</b>: I need this course to finish my Web Tech degree.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Something to Remember Me By</b>: For some reason my nickname given to me by my family as young'n was "Toaster"...</li>

            <li><b>I'd Also Like to Share</b>: I enjoy photography of all types!</li>
        </ul>
